# ByteBazaar API - in use at the ByteBazaar web shop!
## Debug Thug's API application
We received a task to create an web shop and an API service that is meant to be used together. 

##### Technical notes:
We built an API that is published on azure with it's own database. The API contains all products, categories and images related to products. 
The ByteBazaarWeb (see repo https://github.com/ZoranDotNet/BiteBazaarWeb) is also published on azure with it's own database to store all the favorite products, carts, order, account's and everything that is need to give you the ultimate shopping experience.
We have used ASP.Core with C# for this API build.
